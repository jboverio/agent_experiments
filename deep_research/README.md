# Deep Research Agent Experiment

This directory contains an experimental multi-agent system designed for performing deep research tasks.

## Overview

The system utilizes several specialized agents collaborating to achieve a research goal.  

*   **Planner Agent (`planner_agent.py`)**: Plans the research steps.
*   **Search Agent (`search_agent.py`)**: Executes search queries to gather information.
*   **Writer Agent (`writer_agent.py`)**: Compiles and writes the research findings.
*   **Email Agent (`email_agent.py`)**: Potentially handles communication or delivery of the results.
*   **Research Manager (`research_manager.py`)**: Oversees and coordinates the workflow between agents.
*   **Main Script (`deep_research.py`)**: Likely the entry point to run the deep research process.
